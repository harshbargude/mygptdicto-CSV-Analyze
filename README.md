# MyGPTDicto (MY GEMINI Dicto*)

**MyGPTDicto** is a Spring Boot application that leverages the LangChain and Gemini Pro API to read CSV files and answer questions based on their content. Itâ€™s designed to provide an intelligent, conversational way to query data stored in CSV format.

## Features
- Upload and process CSV files
- Ask natural language questions about the CSV data
- Get accurate, AI-powered responses using the LangChain and Gemini Pro API

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have:
- **Java 17** or higher installed
- **Maven** for dependency management
- A valid **Gemini Pro API key** (obtain it from [their official site](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key))

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshbargude/mygptdicto.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mygptdicto
3. **Configure the API key**:
  Open src/main/resources/application.properties and add your Gemini Pro API key:
    ```bash
    google.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
4. **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
5. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run

## API Endpoints

### AiController

Manages CSV uploads, AI-based question answering, and session handling.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | / | Displays the CSV file upload form for data analysis |
| POST | /upload | Uploads a CSV file and a question, processes it with AI, and returns the analysis result. Optionally includes a generated graph if detected in the response |
| POST | /ask | Submits a new question for the previously uploaded CSV file, processes it with AI, and returns the result. Requires a CSV file in session. Optionally includes a generated graph |
| GET | /result | Displays the result page for the latest AI analysis or question response |
| GET | /predict | Displays the page for making predictions using a trained ML model |
| GET | /reset | Clears the CSV content from the session and redirects to the upload page |

### CleanAndProcessController

Handles CSV data analysis and cleaning via an external Python API.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /clean-process | Displays the page for uploading a CSV file for data cleaning and analysis |
| POST | /upload-csv | Uploads a CSV file, sends it to a Python API for analysis, and returns dataset information, missing values, data types, statistics, duplicates, and data quality suggestions |
| POST | /clean_data | Uploads a CSV file with cleaning parameters (e.g., fill value, outlier threshold, null threshold), sends it to a Python API for cleaning, and returns the cleaned CSV file as a downloadable resource |

### ModelTrainController

Facilitates machine learning model training and predictions.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | /train | Displays the page for uploading a CSV file to train a machine learning model |
| POST | /train-model | Uploads a CSV file and target column, trains an ML model via the ML service, stores the model ID in the session, and returns the training result |
| POST | /predict | Uploads a CSV file, uses a trained model (specified by model ID or from session) to make predictions via the ML service, and returns the prediction results |
